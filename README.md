# Terminal Application: LITESPEED CRM for Sales

This application is a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system that helps businesses efficiently manage and store customer data. Developed from my experience in software sales, this application solves a problem I encountered in my previous role.

It allows sales development representatives to quickly identify if a lead has already been assigned to a different team member by entering the company URL. The application includes essential CRM functionality to add new leads, edit existing leads, remove leads, and search/display lead information.
